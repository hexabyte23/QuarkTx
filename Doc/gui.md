# Gui user guide

## First compilation

We make the choice to have the same code for every platforms supported (Win/Mac/Linux/Android/IOS). Qt has been chosen to do so, and you should first install the QtCreator environment [available here](http://qt.io/download).Then, get a copy of QuarkTx source code from <https://github.com/hexabyte23/QuarkTx> by using `Download ZIP` button or by using [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com).

Once the source code is put in your local PC/Mac, doubleclick on Gui/QuarkTx.pro file.
