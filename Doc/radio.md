# Radio user guide

## First compilation

You must first install the arduino software (IDE) from the official arduino site <http://www.arduino.cc> in download section. Then, get a copy of QuarkTx source code from <https://github.com/hexabyte23/QuarkTx> by using `Download ZIP` button or by using [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com).

Once the source code is put in your local PC/Mac, doubleclick on Radio/Radio.ino file. Arduino software will automatically be opened, and Radio.ino source file displayed.

>For **Arduino Nano** user
>
>Before compiling code, you must first select **Arduino Nano** in the Tools/Board type menu. 

or
  
>For **Teensy** user
>
>Before compiling code, you must first install [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html), then select **Teensy 3.2/3.1** in the Tools/Board type menu. 

Once this selection is done, you can plug your device to your local PC/Mac, and press `upload` button.

## First start

Upload is now complete, open Serial Monitor from Arduino IDE, and  you see below first messages during booting sequence:

	Quark Tx v0.1.0
	Booting...	Serial		OK
	Command		OK
	e-edic
	Tx		OK
	2004 Âµs
	Nano
	Ready
	>

The booting section show a line started with **e-**, that means an error is raised during booting. (See [**Error messages**](#error-pane) pane for errors detail).

This '**e-edic**' error can occurs in 2 cases : You really have an EEPROM data corruption or this is the first time ever you start QuartTx. To clean this error we must calibrate all sensors connected.
 

### First calibration

Sensors calibration would  setup limits of all sensors curces. to do so, make sure first that all sensors are connected to the board (as discribe on electric diagram), then execute toggle command `c`. This command make you enter in the calibration mode and you must execute `c` command again to exit from this mode.

In calibration mode you will see real time datas moving like that:

	{381	627}	{393	631}	{389	635}	{385	627}	{0	1}	{0	1}	{0	1}	
	{381	627}	{393	631}	{389	635}	{385	627}	{0	1}	{0	1}	{0	1}	
	{381	627}	{393	631}	{389	635}	{385	627}	{0	1}	{0	1}	{0	1}	

Each pair of numeric data inside {} are the minimal and the maximum limit value (range 0 to 1023) of a given sensor. In that example, sensor 0 minimum limit is 381 and maximum is 627, sensor 1 minimum limit is 393 and maximum is 631, and so on ... 

To calibrate sensors, you must move all sensors physically from their minimum curce to their maximum curce until min/max of each sensors become stable to a unique value. (do not forget mechanical trims on old gimbals and mechanical switches).

***Warning***: Make sure to reach sensor real limits to prevent
 any limit boundary overflow during your fligth that should cause a crash !

When its done, you can exit calibrate mode (by execute `c` again). 

Its now time to save to EEPROM your settings by executing `v` command. You can check that operation succeed to press the hardware reset button on the board. The e-edic error is now supposed to disappear during booting sequence otherwise you have a real EEPROM data corruption problem.

You can now use one of the 22 commands (for v 0.1.0) available (check [**Commands**](#commands-pane) pane for details) or use Gui app(still in dev step) for Win 10/OSX/Android or IOS.

Have fun.
