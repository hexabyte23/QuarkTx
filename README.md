# QuarkTx, up to 17 Channels !!
Radio Control system based on Arduino Nano ATmega 328, with a simple goal: Provide powerfull embedded functions in a small piece of hardware. 

## Gui
Qt client source code for app running on WIN 10, OSX, Android & IOS

## Radio
Arduino Nano ATmega328 source code

## RF Module
We just test with a Jeti TU2 2.4 GHz module. PPM code is able to generate up to 17 different channels !!!

## RCL: a new language
We introduce RCL, a new Radio Control Language, that include gimbal mode, reverse, dual rate, exponetial and mixer functions.
