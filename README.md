# QuarkTx, up to 17 Channels !!
Radio Control system based on Arduino Nano ATmega 328, with a simple goal: Provide powerfull embedded functions in a small piece of hardware. 

## Gui
Qt client source code for app running on WIN 10, OSX, Android & IOS

## Radio
Arduino Nano ATmega328 source code

## RF Module
We just test with a Jeti TU2 2.4 GHz RF module. Smart interrupt code is able to generate up to 17 different PPM channels !!!

## RCL: a new language
We introduce RCL, a real time new Radio Control Language, that include gimbal mode, reverse, dual rate, exponetial and mixer functions per channel.

The average update rate of channels is more than 300 Hz for a 6 channels config with simple RCL commands.
